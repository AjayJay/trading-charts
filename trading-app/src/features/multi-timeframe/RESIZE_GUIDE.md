# 📐 Chart Resize Guide

## ✨ New Feature: Resize Both Horizontally and Vertically

## 🎯 How to Resize Charts

### Method 1: Native CSS Resize (Recommended)

The easiest way to resize charts using the browser's built-in resize functionality:

1. **Hover over any chart**
2. **Look at the bottom-right corner** - you'll see a resize handle (blue indicator)
3. **Click and drag the corner** to resize in both directions simultaneously
4. **Release** to apply the new size

```text
┌─────────────────────┐
│  Chart              │
│                     │
│                     │
│                  ⤡ │ ← Drag this corner!
└─────────────────────┘
```text
#### Advantages

- ✅ Resize both width and height at once
- ✅ Smooth, native browser behavior
- ✅ Visual indicator in corner
- ✅ Precise control

## 📊 Resize Behavior

### What You Can Do

1. **Make Charts Wider**
   - Drag right to increase width
   - Perfect for seeing more candles

2. **Make Charts Taller**
   - Drag down to increase height
   - Better for price action visibility

3. **Make Charts Smaller**
   - Drag inward to decrease size
   - Fit more charts on screen

4. **Independent Sizing**
   - Each chart can be a different size
   - Mix small and large charts as needed

### Minimum Sizes

- **Minimum Width**: 300px
- **Minimum Height**: 400px
- Charts won't go smaller than these limits

---

## 💾 Auto-Save

Your chart sizes are **automatically saved**!

- **When Saved**: After you finish resizing (0.5 seconds after release)
- **Where Saved**: Browser localStorage
- **Persistence**: Sizes persist across page refreshes
- **Reset**: Delete charts and re-add to reset to defaults

---

## 🎨 Visual Indicators

### Resize Handle

When you hover over a chart, you'll see:

```text
Bottom-Right Corner:
┌────────────────────┐
│                    │
│                    │
│              [⤡]  │ ← Blue resize indicator
└────────────────────┘
```text
- **Color**: Blue (#2962ff)
- **Position**: Bottom-right corner
- **Cursor**: Diagonal arrows (↔↕)
- **Visibility**: Appears on hover

---

## 🔧 Technical Details

### How It Works

1. **CSS Resize Property**: Uses native browser `resize: both`
2. **ResizeObserver**: Monitors size changes in real-time
3. **Chart API**: Updates LightweightCharts dimensions
4. **LocalStorage**: Saves dimensions automatically

### Responsive Behavior

Charts adapt to screen size:

- **Desktop (1920px+)**: Default 25% width (4 columns)
- **Laptop (1600px)**: Default 33% width (3 columns)
- **Tablet (1200px)**: Default 50% width (2 columns)
- **Mobile (768px)**: Full width (1 column)

But you can override these by manually resizing!

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. **Create Focus Chart**

Make one chart extra large for detailed analysis:

```text
[Small] [Small]
[LARGE CHART ]
[Small] [Small]
```text
### 2. **Maximize Screen Space**

Resize charts to eliminate gaps:

```text
Before: [Chart] ... [Chart]
After:  [Chart][Chart]
```text
### 3. **Different Sizes for Different Timeframes**

- Make short timeframes (1m, 5m) smaller
- Make long timeframes (1d, 1w) larger

### 4. **Quick Reset**

Delete a chart and re-add it to reset to default size

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Chart Not Visible After Adding

**Solution**: The chart is likely loading. Wait 1-2 seconds for data to appear.

If still not visible:

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify internet connection (data from Binance API)
3. Try refreshing the page
4. Clear localStorage and reload

### Chart Too Small

**Solution**:

1. Hover over the chart
2. Drag the bottom-right corner to make it larger
3. Ensure you're dragging at least 300px x 400px

### Size Not Saving

**Solution**:

1. Ensure localStorage is enabled in your browser
2. Check browser storage quota (shouldn't be an issue)
3. Wait 0.5 seconds after resizing before refreshing
4. Check browser console for errors

### Resize Handle Not Showing

**Solution**:

1. Make sure you're hovering over the chart wrapper
2. Look at the bottom-right corner (not bottom center anymore!)
3. The handle is blue with a diagonal arrows cursor

## 📱 Mobile Behavior

On mobile devices (≤768px):

- Charts are full-width by default
- You can still resize vertically
- Horizontal resize is limited to maintain readability

---

## ⌨️ Keyboard & Mouse

### Mouse Actions

- **Hover**: Shows resize handle
- **Click & Drag Corner**: Resizes chart
- **Release**: Applies size and saves

### Visual Feedback

- **Cursor Changes**: Shows resize cursor (↔↕)
- **Handle Highlights**: Blue glow on hover
- **Real-time Resize**: Chart updates as you drag
